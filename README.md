# Predicting Churn for Bank Customers

## Dependencies
pandas
numpy
sklearn

## Part 1 : Data Preprocessing
This Jupyter Notebook is an example of data preprocessing techniques that can be used to prepare data for predictive modeling. It uses a dataset obtained from Kaggle that contains information about bank customers and their churn rates. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers

- Read in the CSV file using pandas
- Drop any missing values from the dataset
- Drop the 'RowNumber' and 'Surname' columns from the dataset
- Use one-hot encoding to convert object values into numerical values
- Select the columns that need to be normalized
- Create a scaler object
- Fit the scaler to the selected columns
- Transform the selected columns using the scaler
